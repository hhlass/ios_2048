# ios_2048

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game for iOS 16 using SwiftUI. The project is intentionally minimal and can be opened directly in Xcode.

## Building
1. Open Xcode (version 14 or later recommended).
2. Choose **File â†’ Open...** and select the `App` directory of this repository.
3. Xcode will generate a project for the Swift files. Select the `Game2048App` target and build/run on a simulator or device running iOS 16.

## Game Play
Swipe anywhere on the board to move the tiles. Matching tiles merge to form larger values. Use the **New Game** button to restart.
